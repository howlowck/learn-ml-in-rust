# Learning Deep Learning using Rust

I want to learn deep learning and I want to build something with Rust.
This is my way of killing two birds with one stone.

The code base is to keep track of the notes and exercises in the book [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning).

The goal is to grok all the concept in the book, and at the same time port all the python examples in the book to Rust.

## To Run
1. Install Rust
1. Clone the Repo
1. Run `cargo run <PROJECT_NAME>` in the project root

## Projects
1. `simple_forward` - a simple forward evaluation (multi-input, multi-output forward propagation, no Hidden Layers)
